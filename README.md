# Reader

I had seen the Spritz Reader at www.spritz.com and wanted to see if I could make my own version just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any additional libraries or technologies.

The other thing that I was going for here was the ability of a user to run this in a browser without having to serve the page and just from there file system.

Of course you can also use the F12 developer tools in Chrome to set breakpoints and check state.

I have included some sample text along with a Textarea for you to enter your own text.

You can download and unpack the zip file and then open the index.html file in your browser.

I got the best results with Chrome.

Once on the index.html page, select your reading speed and the file you are interested in.

The words in the file will display on the screen between the two lines above.
