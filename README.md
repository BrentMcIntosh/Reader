# Reader

I had seen the Spritz Reader at www.spritz.com and wanted to see if I could make my own version just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any addtional libraries or technologies. 

I have included some sample text along with a Text Area for you to enter your own text.

You can download and unpack the zip file and then open the index.html file in your browser. 

Once on the index.html page, select your reading speed and the file you are interested in.

The words in the file will display on the screen between the two lines above.
